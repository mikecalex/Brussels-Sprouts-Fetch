This purpose of this application is to utilize Fetch calls to a json file when a user clicks on a button.

In the server.rb file, api endpoints were created to pull information from the json file to match certain criteria: random recipe, the longest recipe, and all of the recipes.

In the 'src/containers/SproutsContainer.js' file, the fetch calls were made that are triggered when certain events are triggered by the user.

Run 'bundle' and 'npm install' followed by 'ruby server.rb' & 'npm start' then navigate to http://localhost:4567/ to see the application in action.
